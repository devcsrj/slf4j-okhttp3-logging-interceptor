Slf4j Logging Interceptor
===================

An [OkHttp interceptor][1] which logs HTTP request and response data to an [slf4j logger](http://www.slf4j.org/).

```java
OkHttpClient client = new OkHttpClient.Builder()
  .addInterceptor(new HttpLoggingInterceptor())
  .build();
```

You can change the log level at any time on your corresponding logging configuration. For example, in [log4j](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) you'll use:

```
log4j.logger.okhttp3.logging.wire=DEBUG
```

> See `HttpLoggingInterceptor` javadoc for the output description.

To log to a custom location, pass a `Logger` instance to the constructor.
```java
private static final Logger yourLogger = LoggerFactory.getLogger( YourClass.class );

...

HttpLoggingInterceptor logging = new HttpLoggingInterceptor( yourLogger );
```

> Don't forget to update your logging properties as well!

**Warning**: The logs generated by this interceptor when using the `DEBUG` or `INFO` levels has
the potential to leak sensitive information such as "Authorization" or "Cookie" headers and the
contents of request and response bodies. This data should only be logged in a controlled way or in
a non-production environment.
